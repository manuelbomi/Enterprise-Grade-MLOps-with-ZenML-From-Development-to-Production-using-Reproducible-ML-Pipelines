# Enterprise-Grade MLOps with ZenML : <sub>from Development to Production using Reproducible ML Pipelines</sub>

### Why this repository exists

##### Most machine learning projects fail in production, not because the model is bad, but because:

- Training code is not reproducible

- Experiments are not tracked properly

- Data lineage is unclear

- Dev and prod environments behave differently

- Deployment is manual and fragile

##### This repository demonstrates how to build a real, enterprise-ready MLOps system using ZenML, with:

- Clean pipelines

- Experiment tracking

- Dev → Prod parity

- CI/CD integration

- Infrastructure abstraction

*ZenML is an MLOps framework that turns ML code into versioned, reproducible, deployable pipelines that can run consistently across development and production environments.*
